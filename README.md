# Subnet Calculator

A Python-based tool for IP address and subnet calculations. This utility helps network administrators and students convert between different IP address notations and perform subnet-related calculations.

## Features

- Convert IP addresses between:
  - Decimal notation (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
  - Binary notation (e.g., 11000000.10101000.00000001.00000001)
  - CIDR notation (e.g., /24)
- Calculate subnet information including:
  - Network address
  - Broadcast address
  - Available IP range
  - Total number of usable hosts
- Validate IP address inputs
- Find the parent network for any given IP address
- Plan new subnet ranges within existing networks
